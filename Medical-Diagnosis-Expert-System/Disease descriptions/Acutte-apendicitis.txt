Acute abdominal pain is defined as having an evolution of less

than 48-72 hours, being constantly severe, and accompanied by

by frequent vomiting, general malaise and painful abdominal 

palpation. The diagnosis is clinical, but depending on the clinical

suspicion, complementary tests such as ultrasound may be necessary, 

X-ray of thorax or analysis of blood or urine. From this we can assume

that it is accute appendicitis.
