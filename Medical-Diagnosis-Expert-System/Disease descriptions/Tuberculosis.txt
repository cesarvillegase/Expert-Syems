Tunberculosis is a bacterial disease that usually attacks the lungs. But it can also

attack other parts of the body, including the spine, and the brain. Tuberculosis is 

caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs spread from person 

to person through the air. The people who have TB disease in their throat or lungs

spread the germs in the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
