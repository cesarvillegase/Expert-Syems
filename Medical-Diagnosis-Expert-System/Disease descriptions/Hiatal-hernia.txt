A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper portion of the stomach rises into the chest 

through a small opening in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates

the thorax from the abdomen. The diaphragmatic hiatus is part of the anatomical 

barrier that separates the esophagus from the stomach. If the stomach is displaced 

the stomach towards the thorax, this barrier is not effective and gastric contents

can easily pass into the esophagus. Therefore, the existance of a hiatal hernia favors

gastro-esophageal reflux, but is not its only cause.
